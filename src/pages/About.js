      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 text-center mb-8">
        Inspired by the fascinating <strong>Elysia chlorotica</strong>, a sea slug that can harness energy from the sun, 
        <strong> Elysia</strong> was created with the idea that as we continue to explore and experiment with new recipes, 
        we cultivate self-sufficiency and the ability to thrive. Just like Elysia chlorotica adapts and grows by integrating 
        the best of what it consumes, this app allows food lovers to share, discover, and evolve their cooking skills.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-3">üåø What is Elysia Chlorotica?</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-800">
          Elysia chlorotica is a unique species of sea slug that can perform **photosynthesis**, absorbing energy from the sun like a plant. 
          By incorporating chloroplasts from the algae it eats into its own cells, it becomes **self-sustaining** and requires less food to survive. 
          This incredible ability mirrors our own journey‚Äîby learning new skills and sharing knowledge, we empower ourselves to thrive independently.
