          The Slug That Inspired It All
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-800">
          Elysia chlorotica is a unique species of sea slug that can perform{" "}
          <strong>photosynthesis</strong>, absorbing energy from the sun like a
          plant. By incorporating chloroplasts from the algae it eats into its
          own cells, it becomes <strong>self-sustaining</strong> and requires
          less food to survive. This incredible ability mirrors our own journey
          - by being mindful of what we consume, we empower ourselves to thrive.

          The Vision Behind Elysia
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-800 dark:text-white">
          Cooking is more than just a necessityâ€”it's a way to nourish both body
          and mind. Our vision is to build a platform where people can explore
          diverse recipes, develop new skills, and gradually become more
          self-reliant in the kitchen. Just like Elysia chlorotica adapts and
          grows by integrating the best of what it consumes, this app allows
          food lovers to nurture, discover, and evolve their culinary
          environment.
